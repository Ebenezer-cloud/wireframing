# wireframing
All about wireframing.

Wireframing: is the process of creating a **basic visual guide** that represents the **structure and layout** of a digital product—like a website, mobile app, or software interface—*before* any design elements (colors, images, fonts) are added.

 Key Points About Wireframing:

Purpose: To plan and communicate how a page or screen will function and where key elements (like navigation, buttons, text, images, forms) will be placed.
Level of detail: Usually low-fidelity (simple lines, boxes, and labels), though there are also high-fidelity wireframes that show more detail and interaction.
Used by: UX/UI designers, developers, product managers, and stakeholders to align on the functionality and layout before building the actual product.



 Example (Website Wireframe):

A wireframe for a homepage might include:

* A box for the logo in the top left
* A navigation menu at the top
* A hero image section
* Placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum") for content
* A call-to-action button
* Footer area

Types of Wireframes:

1. Low-Fidelity: Basic sketches or grayscale boxes to outline layout and structure.
2. Mid-Fidelity: More detailed with some content, basic icons, and actual layout dimensions.
3. High-Fidelity: Closer to final design, includes more realistic content, fonts, and basic interactions.


Tools Commonly Used:

 Pen & paper (for quick sketches)
 Digital tools like:

   Figma
